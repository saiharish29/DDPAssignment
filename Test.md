Presentation Objective
========================================================


- The objective is to present the Shiny application created as a course 
project in Developing Data Products course.


Design
========================================================


- The application uses the default mtcars dataset installed with R. It 
contains plot settings for interactive data analysis without much code 
modifications.

- The application can be accessed [here](https://saiharish29.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp2)

- The data is from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and comprises fuel 
consumption and ten characteristics of automobile design and 
performance for 32 cars (1973-74 models).

Plotting
========================================================
To plot in R, just simply run plot(mtcars)
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](Test-figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)
